## Overview

This project is a component of the Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico for the 2023/2024 academic year. 
The challenge is to create a program aimed at maximizing the profit from wooden toy production and sales during the Christmas season.

### Input Specifications

- The input begins with a line containing three integers: `t` (number of toy types), `p` (number of special packages), and `max` (maximum daily toy production).
- It is followed by `n` lines, each with two integers `li` and `ci`, denoting the profit and production capacity of toy `i`.
- Lastly, `p` lines, each containing four integers `i`, `j`, `k`, and `lijk`, representing the profit of the special package `{i, j, k}` and the toys it includes.

### Output Specifications

- Output a single integer representing the maximum profit achievable in a day.
